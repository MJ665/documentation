### Adding and organizing items in Sidebar Categories

Previously we looked at how we added the [**categories**](adding-categories) and [**links**](adding-links) in our sidebars. Now let's have a look at how we will be adding and organizing some `items` in those `category`. 

1. Opening the `sidebars.js` file in our projects's root directory.

2. To add a new item in the category, we created an array **`items`** inside the `docs` array.

    ```jsx title="sidebars.js" {17-19} showLineNumbers
    const sidebars = 
    {
        docs: 
        [
            'about-tcetopensource',
            {
                type: 'category',
                label: 'Projects',
                link: 
                {
                    type: 'generated-index',
                    title: 'Project Docs',
                    description: 'Official Documentation of all TCET Open Source projects',
                    keywords: ['documentation, open-source'],
                },
                collapsed: false,
                items:  [
                    // Items to be added
                ],
                // Other sidebar properties
            },
        ],
        // Other sidebar properties
    }
    module.exports = sidebars;
    ```

3. Now we added the required `items` in the `category` 'Projects'. 
    
    **Here's an example of how we achieved this:**

    ```jsx title="sidebars.js" {13-14} showLineNumbers
    // Other sidebar properties
    type: 'category',
    label: 'Projects',
    link: 
    {
        type: 'generated-index',
        title: 'Project Docs',
        description: 'Official Documentation of all TCET Open Source projects',
        keywords: ['documentation, open-source'],
    },
    collapsed: false,
    items:  [
        'projects/docs-site/about-docs',
        'projects/tcet-linux/about-tcet-linux',
    ],
    // Other sidebar properties
    ```

*Thanks to these changes, we have successfully [**added various items**](adding-items) to the Sidebar of [**TCET Open Source**](https://opensource.tcetmumbai.in/) website, making it more **informative** and **user-friendly**.* Here's how it looks:

import heroImg from "./assets/sidebar-items.png";

<img src={heroImg} style={{ border: "2px solid gray", display: "block", margin: "0 auto" }} />

<br />

import Admonition from '@theme/Admonition';

<Admonition type="caution" title="Important">
    <br />
    <p>
    After successfully adding different `items` to our website's sidebar, we realized that <b>merging similar categories</b> under <b>one parent category</b> would make the sidebar look more <b>organized</b> and <b>effective</b>. This way, child categories inside the parent category could be collapsed, providing a more streamlined and efficient user experience.
    </p>
</Admonition>

_Next, we will explore how we added [**multiple sidebars**](multiple-sidebars) to our website to further enhance the **organization** and **accessibility** of our content. This was done with the same purpose of grouping similar categories together, while keeping the navigation easy for the users._
