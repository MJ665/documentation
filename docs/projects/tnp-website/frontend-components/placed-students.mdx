The [**Students Placed**](https://tnp.tcetmumbai.in/students-placed/) page displays information about the students who secured placements in renowned companies 
and bagged a good package. This section is categorized into **Super Star Performers**, **Star Performers** and 
**All Star Performers**. 

- **Super Star Performers:** Displays Students who have performed exceptionally well throughout the years. 
- **Star Performers:** Displays top students from each academic year (2019-2023) who have performed well. 
- **All Star Performers:** A list of pdfs with all the top performers from each year.

### Super Star Performers 

To create a carousel of cards with the information about the Super Star Performers of TCET, we need to create a functional
component `SuperStarPerformers`. 

**Here's what we did:**

1. Open **"SuperStarPerformers.tsx"** file.

2. **"SuperStarPerformers"** component is created. This component returns `<SwiperSlide>` component to create slides for each performer. Within the `<div>`
element information such as **image**, **batch**, **name**, **company**, **branch** and **package** will be displayed.

**This is how we displayed the image of the student:**

```jsx title="SuperStarPerformers.tsx" {2-6} showLineNumbers
    <div className="min-w-full">
        <img
            className="rounded-lg w-full h-40 object-cover"
            src={superStarPerformer.img}
            alt="Super Star Performer Photo"
        />
    </div>
```

**Batch of the student:**

```jsx title="SuperStarPerformers.tsx" {3} showLineNumbers
    <div className="mt-2">
        <span className="text-sm font-medium px-2 py-1 rounded-full bg-gray-200 text-gray-700">
                {superStarPerformer.batch}
        </span>
    </div>
```

:::info
   In the same way, we displayed name, company, branch and package information of the students in 
   [**SuperStarPerformers.tsx**](https://github.com/tcet-opensource/tnp-website/blob/216af67c8878b8ec82cef31162f94f6a04588c8f/src/components/PlacedStudents/SuperStarPerformers/SuperStarPerformers.tsx#LL100C1-L126C19).

3. This component also returns a `<swiper>` component which represents the main container and defines the overall behaviour of the carousal. 
It is configured with various props. `'breakpoints'` is a prop defined that denotes the change in the number of slides 
based on the width of the screen.

```jsx title="SuperStarPerformers.tsx" {3-16} showLineNumbers
     <Swiper
        //swiper modules
        breakpoints={{
            450: {
                slidesPerView: 2,
                },
            768: {
                slidesPerView: 3,
                },
            1024: {
                slidesPerView: 4,
                },
            1280: {
                slidesPerView: 5,
                },
        }}
        //swiper modules
        >
        </Swiper>
```

4. `'navigation'` prop specifies navigation elements and their associated classes. The elements
with these classes will identify as either **previous button** or **next button**.

```jsx title="SuperStarPerformers.tsx" {4,5} showLineNumbers
     <Swiper
        //swiper modules
        navigation={{
          prevEl: ".swiper-prev", //previous button.
          nextEl: ".swiper-next", //next button.
          disabledClass: "swiper-button-disabled", 
        }}
        //swiper modules
    >    
    </Swiper>
```

### Star Performers 

This section is similar to [**Super Star Performers**](#super-star-performers) section, where star achievers are displayed batch wise. 
For each batch a separate carousel is created. 

For this `starPerformers` array is created which contains information about different batches of students
and their placement data. Each batch has a property **batch** , **color** associated with it and an array of **data** 
containing information about individual students.

```jsx title="index.astro" {3-14} showLineNumbers
    const starPerformers = [
        {
            batch: 2023,
            color: "#FFFAEB",
            data: [
                {
                    img: "/studentPlaced/student_image.jpg",
                    name: "Student Name1",
                    branch: "Branch Name",
                    company: "Meta",
                    package: "23 Lakhs",
                },
                // Other student objects...
            ],
        },
        // Other batch objects...
    ];
```
`StarPerformers` component is rendered for the corresponding data for each batch as we saw in [**Super Star Performers**](#super-star-performers).



### All Star Performers

This section contains downloadable links of pdf containing information about all the star performers from each batch.
Each container is a `<button>` which contains an `svg` icon and anchor tag linking to a pdf that can be 
downloaded upon mouse click. 

```jsx title="index.astro" {3-5} showLineNumbers
    <button>
    <span class="font-title text-lg">
            <a href={item.link} download>
              {item.batch} PDF
            </a>
    </span>
    </button>
```
:::tip
