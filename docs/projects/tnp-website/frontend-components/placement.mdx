The Training and Placement page showcases the placement activities at Thakur College of Engineering and Technology in Mumbai. It provides comprehensive information about the placement process, services, and objectives of the Training and Placement department. The page likely presents data on the **number of students successfully placed**, the **count of companies that have visited** the campus for recruitment, and may also **categorize companies** into different tiers such as **super dream**, **dream**, **normal**, and **core** companies. By visiting the page, visitors can access valuable information and insights into the placement activities at TCET.

## Placement Hero Section

The Placement Hero Section tell us about the placements scenarios in TCET, and also the statistics like `Number of students placed` and `Number of companies visited`.

**Here are the steps we followed to achieve this:**

1. Opening the `PlacementHero.astro` file.

2. The first child contaier of `<div>` showcases the headings and a short description about the **Placements** in TCET.

3. Next up we inserted a `<button>` tag which redirects to the **Guidelines** of placements.

    ```jsx title="PlacementHero.astro" {3-9} showLineNumbers
    <div class="flex space-x-10 lg:flex-row flex-col items-center gap-12 w-full mt-12 mb-12">
        <div class="w-full order-1">
            <h1 class="lg:text-4xl text-3xl mb-4 font-title">About Placement</h1>
            <p class="mb-8 lg:text-base text-md text-slate-500">
                The Training and Placement department serves as a bridge between the
                academic environment and the industry by establishing connections with
                various companies and organizations. The ultimate aim of the T&P
                department is to ensure that students are well-prepared for the job market
                and have access to the resources they need to achieve their career goals.
            </p>
            <button
            class="text-slate-500 hover:bg-slate-100 active:bg-slate-50 transition-all border border-gray-300 rounded-xl px-4 py-2"
            >Visit our Guidelines</button>
        </div>
        <!-- Other containers>
    ```

4. Next we added an `<img>` tag in another `<div>` container specifying its attributes.

    ```jsx  title="PlacementHero.astro" {6-10,13-18} showLineNumbers
    <div class="flex space-x-10 lg:flex-row flex-col items-center gap-12 w-full mt-12 mb-12">
        <!-- First About Us Container -->

        <div class="w-3/4 order-2">
        <div class="mb-6 flex flex-col justify-center gap-6 rounded-xl">
            <img
                src="/Placement/placement.png"
                class="w-full aspect-auto rounded-xl"
                alt="image-of-a-female-student-pointing-towards-a-laptop-screen"
            />
        </div>
    </div>
    ```

5. Now we added the `CountUp Components` by specifiyng the configuration properties like the `start` and `end` and the `title` of the CountUp Component.

    ```jsx title="PlacementHero.astro" {10-15} showLineNumbers
        <!-- First About Us Container -->
        <div class="flex space-x-10 lg:flex-row flex-col items-center gap-12 w-full mt-12 mb-12">
            
            <!-- Image Container -->
            <div class="mb-6 flex flex-col justify-center gap-6 rounded-xl">

                <!-- CountUp Component -->
                <div class="flex justify-between sm:flex-row flex-col items-center gap-3">
                    <div class="w-full md:w-max">
                    <CountUpComponent
                        client:only="react"
                        start={0}
                        end={852}
                        title="Number of students placed"
                    />
                    </div>
                    <!-- Another CountUp Component -->
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
    ```
    :::tip
    Similar steps were carried out for multiple **[CountUp Components](#placement-hero-section)**. 
    ::: 

import PlacementHero from "/docs/projects/tnp-website/assets/PlacementHero.png";

After completing the above steps, we successfully implemented the **Hero** section of Placements in our website. **You can see the snapshot below:**

    <img src={PlacementHero} style={{ border: "2px solid gray" }} />

## Companies Categories

This page section provides detailed statistics on the **successful placements** of students and the number of companies that actively participate in **campus recruitment**. Moreover, these companies are often classified into distinct tiers based on their significance and desirability for students. This categorization includes tiers such as **super dream**, **dream**, **normal**, and **core** companies. This classification helps students gauge the level of competition and prioritize their preferences during the placement process.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem'
import styles from '/src/components/HomepageFeatures/styles.module.css';

import SuperDream from "/docs/projects/tnp-website/assets/SuperDream.png";
import Dream from "/docs/projects/tnp-website/assets/Dream.png";
import Normal from "/docs/projects/tnp-website/assets/Normal.png";
import Core from "/docs/projects/tnp-website/assets/Core.png";

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="Super Dream Companies" attributes={{className: styles.unique}}>
    <img src={SuperDream} style={{ border: "2px solid gray" }} />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Dream Companies" attributes={{className: styles.unique}}>
    <img src={Dream} style={{ border: "2px solid gray" }} />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Normal Companies" attributes={{className: styles.unique}}>
    <img src={Normal} style={{ border: "2px solid gray" }} />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Core Companies" attributes={{className: styles.unique}}>
    <img src={Core} style={{ border: "2px solid gray" }} />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

This sections are already made in our **[Internships](internships)** and **[Companies](companies)** component.
