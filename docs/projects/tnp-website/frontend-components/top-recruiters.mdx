The **Top Recruiters** page of the website gives you information about the top companies and the recuiters during the placement procedure. It is accesible through the Home Page of the [**TNP Website**](https://tnp.tcetmumbai.in/).

### Adding Marquee component to the page

**Steps to add a Marquee Component:*

1. Opening `LogosMarquee.tsx` file in our projects root directory.

2. A functional component called `LogosMarquee` and this component accepts two props: `data` and `oppDirection`.

    ```jsx title="LogosMarquee.tsx" {3-6} showLineNumbers
    const LogosMarquee: React.FC<{
        data: { imgUrl: string; name: string }[];
        oppDirection?: boolean | false;
    }> = ({ data, oppDirection })
    ```

3. The `Marquee` component accepts two props: `direction` specifies the direction of the marquee animation. If `oppDirection` is `true`, the direction is set to "right", otherwise, it is set to "left", `speed` specifies the speed of the marquee animation. 

    ```jsx title="LogosMarquee.tsx" {8} showLineNumbers
    <Marquee  direction={oppDirection ? "right" : "left"} speed={30}>
    ```

4. The `data` prop is an array of objects, where each object has two properties: `imgUrl` (string) and `name` (string). The mapping iterates over each object in the `data` array and generates an `<img>` element for each logo image. The `key` prop is set to the name property for efficient rendering.

    ```jsx title="LogosMarquee.tsx" {4-9} showLineNumbers
    // Other part of section
    return (
    <Marquee  direction={oppDirection ? "right" : "left"} speed={30}>
      {data.map((d) => (
        <img
          key={d.name}
          className="h-8 object-contain"
          src={d.imgUrl}
          alt={d.name}
        />
      ))}
    </Marquee>
    ```

5. Save the changes.

6. Run `yarn dev` on the terminal to see the changes made in your local environment. 

### Adding Logo and Content

**Here's how we added logo and content of the company in the [Top Recruiters](top-recruiters) section**

1. Opening `index.astro` in the 'Top Recruiters` component file in our projects root directory.

2. An array called `data`, which contains multiple objects representing different logos. Each object has two properties: `name` (the name of the company) and `imgUrl` (the URL of the company's logo image).

    ```jsx title="index.astro" {3-6} showLineNumbers
    const data = [
        {
            name: "Accenture",
            imgUrl:
                "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5d23ae890b7dee000180ec51/1586367987659-BZ5L8BA1UZBLNVFMATYK/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kPjg6bM-W17gCtBWJ8Mjp2AUqsxRUqqbr1mOJYKfIPR7LoDQ9mXPOjoJoqy81S2I8N_N4V1vUb5AoIIIbLZhVYwL8IeDg6_3B-BRuF4nNrNcQkVuAT7tdErd0wQFEGFSnBItPiluyZS-UhYJJ6omcW3Y-2_8y8J8iHad74oPUfQWBOqOCHXbC31Z0m-iT7ZRQQ/accenturelogo.png",
        }
        // Repeated multiple times in a marquee
    ]
    ```
  
3. This `div` element contains a text section with information about top recruiters. The text can be added added or edited from this section.

    ```jsx title="index.astro" {46-55} showLineNumbers
    <div class="flex flex-col mt-4 flex-initial xl:w-1/2 md:w-1/2 sm:w-full">
        <div class="m-8">
            <p class="text-3xl font-title pb-4">Top Recruiters</p>
            <p class="text-slate-700 font-Inter">
            TCET has an enviable record in placement of students. The institute has been accredited by major companies like Infosys, Tata Consultancy Services, iGATE, and Tech mahindra, etc.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    ```

4. The four `LogosMarquee` components are rendered within the carousel container. They are responsible for displaying the marquee of logos. Each `LogosMarquee` component receives the `data` prop, which is set to the `data` array defined earlier. 

    ```jsx title="index.astro" {68-71} showLineNumbers
    <LogosMarquee client:only="react" data={data} />
    <LogosMarquee client:only="react" data={data} oppDirection />
    <LogosMarquee client:only="react" data={data} />
    <LogosMarquee client:only="react" data={data} oppDirection />
    ```

5. Save the changes.

6. Run `yarn dev` on the terminal to see the changes made in your local environment.

**On executing the above steps, the individual cards look like this:**

import LogoMarquee_img from "/docs/projects/tnp-website/assets/LogoMarquee_img.png";

<img src={LogoMarquee_img} style={{ border: "2px solid gray" }} />

<br />
<br />

_After successfully implementing the **[Top Recruiters](top-recruiters)** component of the **[TNP (Training and Placement)](https://tnp.tcetmumbai.in)** website, the next step is to move forward with the implementation of the **[About Us](about-us)** component._
