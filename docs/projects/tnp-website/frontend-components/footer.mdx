The footer component is a section of a web page that is placed at the bottom and is separate from the main content area. It serves as a container for information that is relevant to the entire page. In the footer component, we have included **Google map of the institution** as well as the **written address, navigation links, contact details, copyright notices**, and other supplementary information.

## Map Component
This component is represented by the HTML program which includes a map embedded from Google Maps and an address description.

**Here's the implemented code:**

   ```jsx title="index.astro" {3-9,10-16} showLineNumbers
       {/* Map And Address */}
            <div class="w-full lg:w-1/3 xl:w-1/3 m-2">
                <div>
                        <iframe
                            src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d3767.7457229439237!2d72.87241691481825!3d19.20630535285474!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x3be7b0e57647569d%3A0xc0aec329c82d3555!2sThakur%20College%20of%20Engineering%20and%20Technology!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sin!4v1680794472903!5m2!1sen!2sin"
                            style={{ border: 0, width: "100%", height: "27vh" }}
                            loading="lazy"
                            referrer-policy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"></iframe>
                </div>
                <div class="mt-4 text-sm">
                    <p class="text-justify">
                        Thakur College Of Engineering And Technology. A-Block, Thakur
                        Educational Campus, Shyamnarayan Thakur Marg, Thakur Village,
                        Kandivali(E). Mumbai - 400101.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
  ```
**Here's a breakdown explanation of the map component:**

 1. The first `div` element is applied with multiple CSS classes. These are defined with attributes for styling puposes.

 2. The `div` element in the next line contains `<iframe>` element, which is added in the code to embed content from another source. Here, the `src` atribute is **Google Maps embed URL**, which is used to display map of the college in the footer. The CSS classes have been applied.

 3. The `loading` attribute is set to **lazy**, which indicates that iframe should be loaded only when it becomes fully visible. 

 4. The `referrer-policy` is set to **no-referrer-when-downgrade** which is used to restrict the referrer information when loading the embedded Google Maps content. This helps in protecting user's privacy and security.

 5. The next `div` element introduces the `<p> paragraph` element. It represents the paragraph of text that describes the **college address**. There are CSS classes applied to the element as per our specifications.
