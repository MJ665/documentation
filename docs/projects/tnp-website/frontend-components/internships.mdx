The **Internship** page of the website gives you information on various corporations that visit TCET to recruit students. To be more transparent, the website provides statistics on the number of companies that have visited and the number of students who got hired. It is accesible through the navigation bar of the [**TNP Website**](https://tnp.tcetmumbai.in/).

### Adding Company Details

To add a company's information to the website, we need to edit the `data` array in the **InternshipCompanies.tsx** file. The `data` array is a collection of company information where each item represents a company and contains the name and image of the company's logo. 

**Here's how those changes were made:**

1. Opening **InternshipCompanies.tsx** file in our projects root directory. 

2. Locating the `data` array. To add a company's details, we created a new object which would be defined as follows:
   
    ```jsx title="InternshipCompanies.tsx" {3-4} showLineNumbers 
       const data = [
        {
            caption:  "Name of the company",
            imgLink: "company-logo.svg",
        }
       ]
    ```
3. Editing the `caption` property to include the name of the company and `imgLink` property with the name of the file or URL for the company's logo. 

4. Save the file. 

5. Run `yarn dev` on the terminal to see the changes made in your local environment.

### Creating Company Card

Now that we have created `data` array, we need to create a card for each company featuring the company name and logo. 

**Here's how we proceeded with the steps:**

1. Opening `CompanyCard.tsx` file. 

2. `Props` is defined with two properties: `imgLink` and `caption` both of type **"String"**. 
     
     ```jsx title="CompanyCard.tsx" {2-3} showLineNumbers 
        type Props = {
              imgLink: String;
              caption: String;
        };
    ```
3. The functional component `CompanyCard` is created which uses these props to display company logo and name. 

    ```jsx title="CompanyCard.tsx" showLineNumbers
        const CompanyCard = ({ imgLink, caption }: Props) => {
        return (
            //Define the UI of the component
        );
        };
    ```
4. The component will return a `<div>` element which will create a vertical container with centered content and gap between child elements.

     ```jsx title="CompanyCard.tsx" {3,5} showLineNumbers
        const CompanyCard = ({ imgLink, caption }: Props) => {
        return (
            <div className="flex flex-col items-center justify-center gap-3">
            //Other elements comes here
            </div>
        );
        };
    ```
5. Within the `<div>` element, `<img>` is used to display company logo and `<p>` element contains the name of the company as caption. 

    ```jsx title="CompanyCard.tsx" {4,5} showLineNumbers
        const CompanyCard = ({ imgLink, caption }: Props) => {
        return (
            <div className="flex flex-col items-center justify-center gap-3">
                <img src={"/InternshipHero/" + imgLink} alt="company-logo" />
                <p className="lg:text-base text-xs text-center text-slate-600">{caption}</p>
            </div>
        );
        };
    ```
6. Save the file. 

7. Run `yarn dev` on the terminal to see the changes made in your local environment.

**On executing the above steps, the individual cards look like this:**

import cardImg from "/docs/projects/tnp-website/assets/companyCard.png";

<img src={cardImg} style={{ border: "2px solid gray" }} />

<br />
<br />

### Displaying Companies

In this step, we need to create a card to display all the company cards created in the previous step. This step will help in listing all the companies that have conducted internship drives in TCET. 

1. Opening **InternshipCompanies.tsx** file in our projects root directory. 

2. Creating a react functional component `InternshipCompanies` which will be defined as follows:
 
    ```jsx title="InternshipCompanies.tsx" showLineNumbers
      const InternshipCompanies: React.FC<{}> = () => {
        return (
           //Define the UI of the component
         );
      };
    ```

3. A `<div>` element is created which uses inline CSS style to set the background of the component. Within outer `<div>`, `<h1>` is created for the heading of the section-`"Companies Offering Internships"`. It also contains nested `<div>` element with a class which serves as an underline below the heading. 

    ```jsx title="InternshipCompanies.tsx" {3-8} showLineNumbers
       const InternshipCompanies: React.FC<{}> = () => {
            return (
                <div style={{ background: "radial-gradient(42.83% 57.11% at 50% 100%, rgba(255, 225, 185, 0.7) 0%, rgba(255, 245, 232, 0.3) 100%)" }}>
                    <h1 className="relative pb-3 text-2xl 2xl:text-3xl text-center mb-12 font-title">
                    Companies offering Internships 
                    <div className="absolute sm:top-12 top-16 left-1/2 -translate-x-1/2 lg:w-1/5 md:w-1/3 sm:w-1/2 w-full border-b border-slate-200"></div>
                    </h1>
                </div>
            );
        };
    ```

4. A `<div>` is created below `<h1>` element to create grids for the company cards. A javascript expression `"{data.map((d, index) => {.....})}"` is used to map `data` array to display each company card.

    ```jsx title="InternshipCompanies.tsx"{8-12} showLineNumbers
        const InternshipCompanies: React.FC<{}> = () => {
            return (
                <div style={{ background: "radial-gradient(42.83% 57.11% at 50% 100%, rgba(255, 225, 185, 0.7) 0%, rgba(255, 245, 232, 0.3) 100%)" }}>
                    <h1 className="relative pb-3 text-2xl 2xl:text-3xl text-center mb-12 font-title">
                        Companies offering Internships 
                        <div className="absolute sm:top-12 top-16 left-1/2 -translate-x-1/2 lg:w-1/5 md:w-1/3 sm:w-1/2 w-full border-b border-slate-200"></div>
                    </h1>
                    <div className="grid grid-cols-2 md:grid-rows-5 md:grid-cols-5 2xl:grid-cols-6 gap-x-6 gap-y-8 mb-12 pb-12">
                        {data.map((d, index) => {
                            return <CompanyCard key={index} imgLink={d.imgLink} caption={d.caption} />;
                        })}
                    </div>
                </div>
            );
        };
    ```
5. Save the file.

6. Run `yarn dev` on the terminal to see the changes made in your local environment.

**After completing the above steps, the Internship Companies card looks like this:**

import CardImg from "/docs/projects/tnp-website/assets/industryhero.png";

<img src={CardImg} style={{ border: "2px solid gray" }} />
