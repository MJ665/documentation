The **Top Placed Students** section is present on the [**Home Page**](https://tnp.tcetmumbai.in/) of **Training and Placement website** right after the [**Student Awards**](student-award) section.
This section gives an overview of the top students who got recruited in good companies.

### Top Placed Students Component

For this section. we need to create a carousel of slides with information such as **student's image**, **name**, **company name**,
and **package**. For this, we need to create a functional component that will create slides for each student
and a carousel with navigational buttons. 

1. Open **"TopPlacedStudents.jsx"** file.

2. An array is created where each object represents a slide with student's information with the following properties:

```jsx title="TopPlacedStudents.jsx" {3-6} showLineNumbers
   const slideObj = [
        {
            studentImg: "TopPlacedDummy.jpg",
            studentName: "Jayesh Potlabattini",
            companyName: "Company",
            salary: "20 Lakhs",
        },
        // Other objects representing different students
    ];
```

3. In the next step, we will map through each object within `slideObj` array and create a set of Swiper slides. A `<SwiperSlide>`
component is rendered for each student object. Within `<SwiperSlide>` component, we are going to see how we displayed student's information:

**For student's image:**

```jsx title="TopPlacedStudents.jsx" {3-6} showLineNumbers
   <SwiperSlide
    <div className="min-w-full">
        <img
            src={`/TopPlacedStudent/${data.studentImg}`}
            alt={data.studentName}
        />
    </div>
    >
    </SwiperSlide>
```

:::info
   Similarly, other information such as [**studentName**](https://github.com/tcet-opensource/tnp-website/blob/216af67c8878b8ec82cef31162f94f6a04588c8f/src/components/TopPlacedStudents/TopPlacedStudents.jsx#LL75C22-L75C22), [**companyName**](https://github.com/tcet-opensource/tnp-website/blob/216af67c8878b8ec82cef31162f94f6a04588c8f/src/components/TopPlacedStudents/TopPlacedStudents.jsx#LL76C13-L76C13) and [**salary**](https://github.com/tcet-opensource/tnp-website/blob/216af67c8878b8ec82cef31162f94f6a04588c8f/src/components/TopPlacedStudents/TopPlacedStudents.jsx#LL78C1-L83C17) is displayed.

4. A `<Swiper>` component is created which displays all the mapped slides in a container.
It defines the overall behaviour of the carousel and is configured with various props. 
`breakpoints` is a prop defined that denotes the change in the number of slides based on the width of the screen.

```jsx title="TopPlacedStudents.jsx" {3-20} showLineNumbers
    <Swiper
        //swiper modules
         breakpoints={{
          420: {
            slidesPerView: 2,
          },
          640: {
            slidesPerView: 3,
            spaceBetween: 30
          },
          768: {
            slidesPerView: 4,
          },
          1024: {
            slidesPerView: 5,
          },
          1280: {
            slidesPerView: 6,
          },
        }}
        //swiper modules
        >
    </Swiper>
```
`navigation` prop specifies navigation elements and their associated classes. The elements which are defined with these classes will identify as either **previous button** or **next button**.

```jsx title="TopPlacedStudents.jsx" {3-7} showLineNumbers
    <Swiper
        //swiper modules
        navigation={{
          prevEl: ".swiper-prev", //previous button.
          nextEl: ".swiper-next", //next button.
          disabledClass: "swiper-button-disabled", 
        }}
        //swiper modules
    >    
    </Swiper>
```
4. Two div elements for the previous and next navigation buttons are defined. These elements contain image elements for the navigation buttons which can be seen 
in [**TopPlacedStudents.jsx**](https://github.com/tcet-opensource/tnp-website/blob/216af67c8878b8ec82cef31162f94f6a04588c8f/src/components/TopPlacedStudents/TopPlacedStudents.jsx#LL125C1-L130C15). Also, refer 
[**index.astro**](https://github.com/tcet-opensource/tnp-website/blob/main/src/components/TopPlacedStudents/index.astro) to see how we displayed the heading of the section.

**The above steps gives the following output:**

import tps from "/docs/projects/tnp-website/assets/TopPlacedStudents.png";

    <img src={tps} style={{ border: "2px solid gray"}} />

_Let's move on to the next section, where we will see how we implemented [**Placed Students**](placed-students) section._
