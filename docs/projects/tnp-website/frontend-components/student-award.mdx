The Student Award section aims at recognizing the contributions of the students and showcasing their achievements. This section is situated below the [**Hero Section**](hero) of [**TNP Home Page**](https://tnp.tcetmumbai.in/). 

### Creating Achievement and Award Slides

In order to implement **Student Award Section**, we need to create react functional components for both achievement and award slides. 

**The following steps are executed:**

1. Opening the **StudentAward.jsx** file.

2. All the dependencies and relevant modules are imported. 

    ```jsx title="StudentAward.jsx" showLineNumbers
        import { Swiper, SwiperSlide } from "swiper/react";
        import {
            Navigation,
            Pagination,
            Scrollbar,
            A11y,
            FreeMode,
            Autoplay,
        } from "swiper";

        import "swiper/css";
        import "swiper/css/navigation";
        import "swiper/css/pagination";
        import "swiper/css/scrollbar";
        import "swiper/css/free-mode";
    ```

2. A `StudentAward` component is structured as below: 

    ```jsx title="StudentAward.jsx" showLineNumbers
        const StudentAward = () => {
            // Component logic goes here

        return (
            <div className=" gap-4 flex flex-col md:flex-row">
            {/* Render Swiper components */}
            </div>
        );  
    };
    ```

3. Two data arrays, `achievementSlideObj` and `awardSlideObj` are defined in the above component to store and edit data for achievement and award slides. 
 
    ```jsx title="StudentAward.jsx" {2-5,9-11} showLineNumbers
        const achievementSlideObj = [
            studentImg: //image comes here,
            achievementType: //define type of achievement,
            studentName: //student name comes here,
            caption: //Description of the achievement,
        ];

        const awardSlideObj = [
            awardImg: //image comes here,
            awardName: //Name of the award,
            caption: //Description comes here,
        ];
    ```
4. In the next step, JSX elements for `achievementSlides` are defined using the `achievementSlideObj` data and the structure is customized as needed. 

    ```jsx title="StudentAward.jsx" showLineNumbers
        const achivementSlides = achievementSlideObj.map((data) => {
        return (
            <SwiperSlide key={data.studentName}>
                {/* Render achievement slide content */}
            </SwiperSlide>
        );
        });
    ```

 In the same way, `awardSlides` using `awardSlideObj` data are defined.

    ```jsx title="StudentAward.jsx" showLineNumbers
        const awardSlides = awardSlideObj.map((data) => {
            return (
                <SwiperSlide key={data.awardName}>
                    {/* Render award slide content */}
                </SwiperSlide>
            );
        });
    ```

5. Swiper Components by passing the JSX for achievements and award slides are defined in this step. **This is done in the following way:**

    ```jsx title="StudentAward.jsx" {8-14,18-24} showLineNumbers
        const StudentAward = () => {
            // Component logic goes here

        return (
            <div className="gap-4 flex flex-col md:flex-row">
                {/*Left section*/}
                /* Swiper for Awards */
                <Swiper className="h-auto w-full lg:w-[48%] border rounded-lg xl:rounded-xl" 
                modules={[Navigation, A11y, Autoplay]} 
                spaceBetween={30} 
                slidesPerView={1} 
                navigation={...}>
                {awardSlides}
                </Swiper>

                {/*Right Section*/}
                {/* Swiper for Achievements */}
                <Swiper className="h-auto w-full lg:w-[48%] border rounded-lg xl:rounded-xl"
                modules={[Autoplay]} 
                spaceBetween={30} 
                slidesPerView={1} 
                navigation={...}>
                {achivementSlides}
                </Swiper>
            </div>
        );
        };
    ```

6. Component's appearance and functionality are customized according to the requirements. 

7. Save the file. 

8. Run `yarn dev` to see the changes in your local system.

<h3>The above steps results into the following output:</h3>

import awardImg from "/docs/projects/tnp-website/assets/Awards.png";

<img src={awardImg} style={{border: "2px solid grey"}} />
