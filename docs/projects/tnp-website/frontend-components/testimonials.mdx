Introducing Testimonials of TNP Website!

The **Student Testimonials** and **Company Testimonials** section of the website provides you feedbacks and experiences shared by the students and the companies visiting in TCET. 
It is a responsive and touch-enabled slider which includes data like feedback, student's image or company logo, name and position. It supports slide touch gestures and is situated at the bottom of the **[Home Page](https://tnp.tcetmumbai.in/)** of TNP website. 

### Adding Testimonials

To add reviews on the website, we need to edit **"studentTestimonials"** or **"companyTestimonial"** array in `index.astro` file. Both of these array contain multiple testimonial objects of the type **TestimonialType**.

**Here's how we made those changes: **

1. Opening `index.astro` file in our projects root directory.

2. Locating the  `studentTestimonials` or `companyTestimonial` array.

3. To add a new testimonial, we created a new object which would be defined as follows:

   ```jsx title="index.astro" {2-5} showLineNumbers
       {
          info: //Testimonial content,
          photo: //file name or url of an image,
          name: //name of the student/company,
          position: //position or role of the student/company recruiter,
        }
    ```
4. To add or change the testimonial content, we edited the `info` property and also, updated the `photo` property with the required name of the file or url of the image.

     ```jsx title="index.astro"{2,3} showLineNumbers
       {
          info: "As I stare out the window, I can see the leaves of the trees rustling in the wind. The sun is setting, freshly cut grass. I take a deep breath and let it out slowly, feeling the tension in my body release. In this moment, everything feels perfect, and I am grateful for the simple joys in life.",
          photo: "pfp-pixelated.png",
          name: //name of the student/company,
          position: //position or role of the student/company recruiter,
        }
    ```

5. To add the name of the reviewer and position they hold, we located the `name` and `position` property of the array.

    ```jsx title="index.astro" {4,5} showLineNumbers
       {
          info: //Testimonial content,
          photo: //file name or url of an image,
          name: "Rahil",
          position: "badeLog",
        }
    ```

6. Save the `index.astro` file.

### Displaying Testimonials

 To display a testimonial slider, a  `data` prop is given to the `TestimonialSwiper` component in **"TestimonialSwiper.tsx"** file. `TestimonialSwiper` is a react functional component that recieves an array of **TestimonialType** objects. 

 1. `Swiper` and `SwiperSlide` components are used within the `TestimonialSwiper`provided by the **Swiper.js** library. Within the `Swiper` component, the behaviour and appearance of the component is configured. 

 ```jsx title="TestimonialSwiper.tsx" {2-5} showLineNumbers
      <Swiper
        modules={[Navigation, Pagination, Scrollbar, A11y]}
        spaceBetween={50}
        slidesPerView={1}
        pagination={{ clickable: true }}
        // onSwiper={(swiper) => console.log(swiper)}
        // onSlideChange={() => console.log("slide change")}
      >
 ```
 2. For each testominial object, a `SwiperSlide` component is rendered to define the content for individual slides within the Swiper component. 

 ```jsx title="TestimonialSwiper.tsx" {3-8} showLineNumbers
        {data.map((testimonial) => (
      <SwiperSlide key={testimonial.name}>
        <Testi
            info={testimonial.info}
            photo={testimonial.photo}
            name={testimonial.name}
            position={testimonial.position}
        />
       </SwiperSlide>
        ))}
 ```
 
 The `Testi` component represents an individual testimonial. It receives the testimonial's `info`, `photo`, `name`, and `position` as props and renders them accordingly. The component includes HTML elements and CSS classes to structure and style the testimonial content.

3. Save the file and run `yarn dev` on the terminal to see the changes made in your local environment.

**After following the above steps, the Testimonials section looks like this:**

import testiImg from "/docs/projects/tnp-website/assets/testimonials.png";

<img src={testiImg} style={{ border: "2px solid gray" }} />
