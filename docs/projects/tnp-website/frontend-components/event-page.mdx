The **Event** page of the website gives you information about various training and placement events falling under aptitude training and student development programs. It is accesible through the navigation bar of the [**TNP Website**](https://tnp.tcetmumbai.in/).

### Adding Carousel to the Hero Section

**Here are the steps we performed to add a Caraousel in our Event page**

1. Opening `HeroCarousel.tsx` file in our projects root directory.

2. The array of objects named `heroSlideObj` that contains the image links and alt text for the event, will be loacted. For each object in the array, it generates a `<SwiperSlide>` component with an `<img>` element inside.

    ```jsx title="HeroCarousel.tsx" {3-4} showLineNumbers
    const heroSlideObj = [
        {
            img: "EventPage.png",
            alt: "Event 1",
        }
    ]
    ```

3. The `<Swiper>` component is rendered, which is a container for the event images. It accepts several props to configure its behavior and appearance. 

    ```jsx title="HeroCarousel.tsx" {4-7} showLineNumbers
    const heroSlide = heroSlideObj.map((data) => {
        return (
            <SwiperSlide>
                <img
                src={`/EventsPage/${data.img}`}
                className="object-cover h-full w-full"
                alt={data.alt}
            />
        </SwiperSlide>
        );
    });
    ```

4. The `modules` prop is used to specify additional modules for the `Swiper` library. The `autoplay` prop is used to enable autoplay for the slideshow. The `spaceBetween` prop defines the spacing between each slide. The `slidesPerView` prop sets the number of slides to display at once. The `onSwiper` and `onSlideChange` props are optional event handlers. 

    ```jsx title="HeroCarousel.tsx" {5-13} showLineNumbers
    return (
        <Swiper
            className="h-auto xl:w-[540px] lg:w-[480px] md:w-full border rounded-lg xl:rounded-xl "
            // install Swiper modules
            modules={[Autoplay]}
            autoplay={{
                delay: 3000,
            }}
            spaceBetween={30}
            slidesPerView={1}
            onSwiper={(swiper) => console.log(swiper)}
            onSlideChange={() => console.log("slide change")}
        >
            {heroSlide}
        </Swiper>
    );
    ```

5. Each object should have a `img` property that specifies the image file name and an`alt` property that specifies the alternative text for the image.

6. Save the changes.

7. Run `yarn dev` on the terminal to see the changes made in your local environment. 

### Adding Purpose of the Event Section

**After adding Carousel, let's have a look at  how we implemented the Purpose of the Event Section**

1. Opening `index.astro` file inside the `Hero` component our projects root directory.

2. Locate the following code snippet inside the component or section where you want to display it.

    ```jsx title="index.astro" {5-7,9-11} showLineNumbers
    <div>
      //Other styling
        <div class="md:w-1/2 pr-8">
          <h1 class="text-[42px] font-title">Purpose</h1>
          <p class="lg:text-lg text-sm  font-sans font-light text-[#475466]">
            {purpose}
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="md:w-1/2 w-full h-full lg:mt-0 mt-6">
          <Hero heroSlideObj={heroSlideObj} client:load />
        </div>
      // Other parts of the component
    </div>
    ```

3. Replace the `{/* Add your purpose text here */}` comment with the actual purpose text you want to display.

4. Save the changes.

5. Run `yarn dev` on the terminal to see the changes made in your local environment.

**On executing the above steps, the individual cards look like this:**

import Hero_img from "/docs/projects/tnp-website/assets/Hero_img.png";

<img src={Hero_img} style={{ border: "2px solid gray" }} />

<br />
<br />


### Adding Objective of the Event Section

**Let's have a look at how we integrated this section in our Event page.**

1. Opening `index.astro` file inside the `Testimonial` component our projects root directory.

2. Insert the following code snippet into your HTML or JSX file where you want to display the objective:

    ```jsx title="index.astro" {3-6} showLineNumbers
    <div>
      // Other parts and styling of the container
        <h1 class="font-title text-[42px] mb-[15px]">Objective</h1>
        <p class="lg:text-lg text-sm  font-sans font-light text-[#475466] lg:w-[60%] md:w-[70%]">
            {objective}
        </p>
      // Other parts of the container
    </div>
    ```

3. Replace `{objective}` in the code with the actual variable or string that contains the `objective` content. This is where you provide the objective text that you want to display on the page.

4. Save the file. 

5. Run `yarn dev` on the terminal to see the changes made in your local environment.

import Objective from "/docs/projects/tnp-website/assets/objective.png";

<img src={Objective} style={{ border: "2px solid gray" }} />


### Adding Testimonial Section

**Let's understand how we add the statistics testimonial to the event page**

1. Opening `Testimonial.jsx` file in our projects root directory.

2. Create a new functional component called `Testimonial` and pass the `data` prop to it.

  ```jsx title="Testimonial.jsx" {17} showLineNumbers
  function Testimonial({ data }) {
    // ... code continues
  
  ```}

3. Inside the `Testimonial` component, map through the `data` array to create `SwiperSlide` components dynamically. This will generate a testimonial slide for each item in the `data` array.

  ```jsx title="Testimonial.jsx" {3-10} showLineNumbers
  const TestiSlide = data.map((data) => {
    return (
      <SwiperSlide
        className=" h-auto border-none rounded-lg xl:rounded-xl"
        style={{
          background:
            "radial-gradient(61.56% 85.33% at 50% 100%, rgba(212, 185, 255, 0.7) 0%, rgba(241, 232, 255, 0.3) 100%)",
        }}>
        {/* ... testimonial content */}
      </SwiperSlide>
    );
  });
  ```
Here, you can edit objects containing testimonial information such as `review`, `photo`, `position`, `name`, and `department`. Update the paths of the images or adjust the styling as desired.

4. Configure the `Swiper` component's properties such as `autoplay`, `pagination`, and `breakpoints` according to your requirements.

  ```jsx title="Testimonial.jsx" {6-9,12-17} showLineNumbers
  return (
  <div>
    <Swiper
      className="h-auto my-7"
      modules={[Autoplay, Pagination]}
      autoplay={{
        delay: 3000,
      }}
      pagination={{ clickable: true }}
      spaceBetween={32}
      slidesPerView={1}
      breakpoints={{
        640: {
          slidesPerView: 1,
        },
        // Other config properties
      }}
      onSwiper={(swiper) => console.log(swiper)}
      onSlideChange={() => console.log("slide change")}
    >
      {TestiSlide}
      {/* ... other elements */}
      <div className="swiper-pagination" />
    </Swiper>
  </div>
  );

  ```

5. Save the file to update the changes.

6. Run `yarn dev` on the terminal to see the changes made in your local environment.

**On executing the above steps, the individual cards look like this:**

import testimonial_img from "/docs/projects/tnp-website/assets/Testimonial_img.png";

<img src={testimonial_img} style={{ border: "2px solid gray" }} />

<br />
<br />

**How to add information to the testimonial**

1. Opening `index.astro` file in `Testimonial` component in our projects root directory.

2. Inside the `testiObj` array of the code, add a faculty's details which would be defined as follows:

  ```jsx title="index.astro" {4-9} showLineNumbers
      const testiObj = 
      [
          {
              name: "Name of the Faculty",
              photo: "/faculty-image.jpg",
              review:
                  "Reviews and detail about the Faculty",
              position: "Position of the Faculty",
              department: "Department of the Faculty"
          }
      ]
  ```

3. Edit the above terms `name`. `photo`, `review`, `position`, `department` to include the faculty information to the testimonial. 

4. Save the file. 

5. Run `yarn dev` on the terminal to see the changes made in your local environment.


### Adding Outcome Section

**Let's understand how to add the Outcome Section to the Event Page**

1. Opening `index.astro` file in `Outcome` component in our projects root directory.

2. Define an interface called `Props` that includes a property `outcomes` of type `string[].`

  ```jsx title="index.astro" {2} showLineNumbers
  interface Props {
    outcomes: string[];
  }
  ```

3. Use the `map` function to iterate over the `outcomes` array and generate a `<p>` element for each outcome.

  ```jsx title="index.astro" {2-6} showLineNumbers
  {outcomes.map((item, index) => (
    <p
      className="lg:text-lg text-sm font-sans font-light text-475466 lg:w-60% md:w-70% py-1"
      key={index} >
      {item}
    </p>
  ))}
  ```

4. Save the file.

5. Run `yarn dev` on the terminal to see the changes made in your local environment.

**On executing the above steps, the individual cards look like this:**

import outcomes_img from "/docs/projects/tnp-website/assets/outcomes_img.png";

<img src={outcomes_img} style={{ border: "2px solid gray" }} />

<br />
<br />
