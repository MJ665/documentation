The footer component in **[Fill My Cycle](https://fillmycycle.tcetmumbai.in/)** contains the information about the developer and maintainer of the website. Along with this, we also have our organization's logo.

**Here's How we implemented the code:-**

```html {2-5} showLineNumbers
<hr class="footer-line">
   <div class="text-center">
     Designed & Developed by: Sagar Pathare (TCET 2015-2019)<br>
       Packaged and Maintained by: Gaurang Vishwakarma (TCET 2019-2023)<br>
        <img src="./assets/images/tos-logo.png" alt="TCET Open Source Logo">
</div> 
```

**Here's a breakdown explanation of the Footer component:**

1. The footer line was defined to create a different footer section on our website.

2. The details regarding the **Developer** and **Maintainer** were intergarted in the next container.

3. In the same container, we also centered our **organization's logo**.

**After performing the above steps, our footer looks like this:**

import footer from "/docs/projects/fmc-website/assets/footer.png";

<img src = {footer} style={{ border: "2px solid gray" }} />
<center><figcaption><b>Footer of FMC Website</b></figcaption></center>
<br />
