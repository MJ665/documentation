The **`perform()`** function helps us *find and work with specific tables, calculate the averages of the numbers in those tables*, and then move on to perform additional actions using the "check()" function. It's like a script for a show, where we do things in a specific order to make everything work smoothly!

```jsx title="script.js"{2-6} showLineNumbers
function perform(){
	var tbl01=document.getElementById("tbl01");
	avg(tbl01);
	var tbl02=document.getElementById("tbl02");
	avg(tbl02);
	check();
}
```

Let's go through each step of the code:

1.	First, we **find a table** called `tbl01`. It's like a special chart with rows and columns. We use a special code called `document.getElementById()` to find this table.

2.	Then, we do something special with this table. We call another function called `avg(tbl01)`. It's like telling someone to *find the average of the numbers in that table.* So, we're asking for the average of all the numbers in the table `tbl01`.

3.	We **repeat the same process** with another table called `tbl02`. We find it using the same special code `.getElementById()` and then call the `avg(tbl02)` function to find the average of the numbers in that table too.

4.	After finding the averages of both tables, we move on to the next task. We call another function called `check()`. It's like asking someone to *perform a checklist or a set of instructions.*

5.	Inside the `check()` function, there might be more instructions and actions happening, this function helps us find things on a web page, move around when we type, do some calculations, and maybe show us some results later.
