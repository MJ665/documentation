# Input Handler

This *function is triggered* when a **key is pressed on an input field.** Let's break down the JavaScript function `expkeyup()` in simple terms:

```jsx title="script.js"{2-9,15,18,21-22,24-25} showLineNumbers
function expkeyup(){
	if(event.keyCode==9 || event.keyCode==16)
		return false;
	var ip = event.target || event.srcElement;
	if(ip.value){
		if(ip.value.length>=2 && ip.value!="10"){
			var next=ip.parentElement.parentElement.nextElementSibling
			if(next){
				next=next.lastElementChild.firstElementChild;
			}
			var last1=ip.parentElement.parentElement.parentElement.lastElementChild.lastElementChild.firstElementChild;
			var last2=document.getElementById("tbl02").lastElementChild.lastElementChild.firstElementChild;
			var val = parseInt(ip.value);
			if(val<0){
				ip.value=0;
			}
			else if(val>100){
				ip.value=100;
			}
			if(ip==last2){
				$(ip).blur();
				location.replace("#result");
			}
			else if(ip==last1){
				$("#tbl02 tr input:first").focus();			
			}
			else{
				$(next).focus();
			}
		}
	}
	perform();
}
```

  1.	We start by checking if the key code of the *pressed key is either 9 (Tab key) or 16 (Shift key).* If it is, we **stop further execution** of the function and **return false.** It's like ignoring certain keys that we don't want to respond to.
  
  2.	We *identify the input field where the key was pressed.* It's like finding the specific input field where we are typing.
  
  3.	We *check if the input field has a value.* If it does, we perform some actions inside this condition.
  
  4.	We check if the value in the **input field** has a **length of at least 2 characters and is not equal to "10".** If it meets these conditions, we proceed with further actions.
  
  5.	We *find the next input field by navigating* through the HTML elements. It's like finding the next input field in a sequence.
  
  6.	We also find the *last input field* in another table with the ID `tbl02`. These fields are located somewhere else in the HTML structure.
  
  7.	We **convert** the value in the *current input field to an integer* and store it in a variable called `val`. It's like reading the number entered in the input field.
  
  8.	We *check if the value is less than 0.* If it is, we set the value of the input field to 0. It's like ensuring that the value is not negative.
  
  9.	We *check if the value is greater than 100.* If it is, we set the value of the input field to 100. It's like ensuring that the value is not greater than 100.
  
  10.	We *check if the current input field is the last input field* in `tbl02`. If it is, we **blur the input field** (remove focus) and **replace** the location hash with **"#result".** It's like moving the focus away from the input field and updating the URL.
  
  11.	If the *current input field is not the last input field* in `tbl02`, we check if it is the last input field in its parent row. If it is, we find the *first input field in the first row of `tbl02` and give it focus.* It's like moving the focus to the first input field in the next row.
  
  12.	If none of the above conditions are met, we move the **focus to the next input field using jQuery's "$()" function.** It's like shifting the focus to the next input field in the sequence.
  
  13.	Finally, we call the `perform()` function, which is not defined in this code snippet but helps us find and define tables.
        So, this function helps us respond to keyup events in input fields. It *performs validation on the input value, navigates to the next input field, updates the URL, and triggers the `perform()` function.* It's like a handler that listens to keyboard input and manages the flow of focus and actions accordingly!
