The `check_man()`** function checks and manages values in two tables.** It calculates some values for each table and performs an action with the calculated results. It's like checking and handling the values in a organized way!
This function checks and manages values in two tables. Let's go through each step:

``` jsx title="script.js"{5-7} showLineNumbers
function check_man(){
	var tbl1=document.getElementById("tbl1");
	var tbl2=document.getElementById("tbl2");
	var w=[];
	w[0]=cal_man(tbl1);
	w[1]=cal_man(tbl2);
	cycle(w[0],w[1]);
}
```
1.	We start by **finding a table** with the ID "tbl1" and storing it in the variable "tbl1". It's like picking the first table.

2.	Then, we **find another table** with the ID "tbl2" and store it in the variable "tbl2". It's like picking the second table.

3.	We *create an empty array* called "w". It's like having a list to store values.

4.	We **calculate some values** for the first table using the `cal_man()` function and store the result in the first element of the "w" array (at index 0).

5.	Similarly, we **calculate some values** for the second table using the `cal_man()` function and store the result in the second element of the "w" array (at index 1).

6.	Finally, we call the `cycle()` function, passing the calculated values from the first table (w[0]) and the second table (w[1]) as arguments. It's like performing some action with those values.
